    "When a string is given there are certain part that we need to check before others to determine if such string belongs to the language , so we need to give a precedence order to thense parts of the string and analize it. Let's say we have a vocabulary $V$ where reminds all of the symbols we have in our language, which is composed of terminals.\n",
    "\n",
    "The proposal of this articule is to define the language as $< Gr,G >$ pair where $Gr$ is the grammar productions of the language and $G = < V,P >$ is a graph relationships between terminal where  $V$ are all the terminals ( vertices of the graph ) and $P$ is the relationship between two terminals. If $<t_0,t_1> \\in P$ then the parser can reduce stack when it has $t_0$ in stack, sees $t_1$ and has a production that matches the top of the stack containing $t_0$. If $<t_0,t_1> \\notin P$ then the parser shifts the character. So the problem to determine if a given string belongs to our language is to determine if the graph builded from the given string is a sub graph of the graph builded from the grammar defined. \n",

    "The Gradient Parser is a buttom-up parser that takes some features of others shift | reduce parsers that peformes reduction or shift based on the criteria of symbols precedence indicated in the `matrix precedence` (adjacency matrix) and also takes similar features from others parser such as the look-ahead feature and the automaton is quite similar but with some small changes that makes it different. This all allows this parser to retrives more expressiveness of the grammar and such time complexity is $O(n)$ where $n$ is the length of the code. Its components are: a stack whose contains seen terminals and non-terminals . It has a `stack pointer` that stores the position of seen terminals in the string in the form $( index , t )$.\n"

In more ambiguos grammar it can be peformed a much more look-ahead sight , up to the length the parser will re-observe , because it has no sense the parser looks longer then the terminal pointer that makes it peforms a shift action , due to there is no concept here of viable prefix has in others shift | reduce parsers \n"
